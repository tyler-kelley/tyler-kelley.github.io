<h1>The Bacon-Chocolate Shot Glass.</h1>

<p>Life as we know it will never be the same.

<h2>Here's what you'll need...</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Bacon</strong>(*thick cut for best results)</em> ~ Each glass will take about 1 & 1/2 slices so plan accordingly for however many glasses you want to make</li>
  <li><em><strong>Chocolate</strong></em> ~ Any plain milk chocolate will do, however I find chocolate chips the easiest to melt down</li>
  <li><em><strong>Shot Glass Mold</strong></em> ~ You're going to need something to wrap the bacon around to create the shot glass shape. For this you can use an actual shot glass or you could use the cardboard core of a roll of paper towels wrapped in tin foil</li>
  <li><em><strong>Twine</strong></em> ~ To tie the bacon in place around your shot glass mold</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Find or make the shot glass mold you would like to wrap your bacon around to cook. If you choose to use the paper towel core, be sure to wrap each individually cut cylinder with tin foil, inside & out</li>
  <li>Cut your bacon into 4 seperate pieces: Two short pieces for the base of the glass & two longer pieces to wrap around your mold</li>
  <li>Make an "X" with your shorter pieces of bacon at the bottom of your mold. Make sure that there arent any large gaps in this base. (Small ones are fine as long as you can close them with the chocolate)</li>
  <li>Wrap the two longer pieces of bacon around the mold from the bottom up</li>
  <li>Use the twine to tie off the bacon wrapped around your mold at the top</li>
  <li>Next it's time to bake your bacon glasses. Place your bacon molds upside down on a wire rack and bake them at 375 degrees for 20-30 minutes, or until the bacon looks slightly crispy (*try not to over cook!)</li>
  <li>After the bacon is done, let the glasses sit for 10 minutes before gently removing the bacon from the molds. To remove the bacon from the molds, lightly squeeze around the mold to free the bacon. (This is the hardest part but after your first few you should get the hang of it)</li>
  <li>Once you've removed the bacon glasses from their molds, melt down your chocolate in a double boiler and with a spoon, scoop some of the melted chocolate into one of the cups. Make sure to cover up any small holes you see</li>
  <li>Finally, chill the bacon and chocolate molds in the refridgerator for no less than 1 hour. After that you can remove the glasses and fill them up with whatever bacon friendly booze you can think of!</li>
